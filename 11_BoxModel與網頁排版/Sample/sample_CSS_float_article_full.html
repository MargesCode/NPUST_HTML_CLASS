            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>Hokkaido (北海道 Hokkaidō, literally "Northern Sea Circuit"; Japanese pronunciation: [hokkaꜜidoː] (About
                this soundlisten)), formerly known as Ezo, Yezo, Yeso, or Yesso, is the second largest island of Japan,
                and the largest and northernmost prefecture. </p>
            <p>The Tsugaru Strait separates Hokkaido from Honshu. The
                two islands are connected by the undersea railway Seikan Tunnel. The largest city on Hokkaido is
                its
                capital,Sapporo, which is also its only ordinance-designated city. </p>
            <p>About 43 km north of Hokkaido lies Sakhalin
                Island, Russia. To its east and north-east are the disputed Kuril Islands.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="sec2">
            <h2> Wildlife</h2>
            <p>There are three populations of the Hokkaido brown bear subspecies (Ursus arctos yesoensis). There are
                more brown bears in Hokkaido than anywhere else in Asia besides Russia. </p>
            <p>The Hokkaido brown bear is separated into three distinct lineages. There are only eight lineages in the
                world. Those on Honshu died out
                long ago.</p>
            <p> Native conifer species in Northern Hokkaido is the Abies sachalinensis (sakhalin fir) The
                Hydrangea hirta species is also located on this island.</p>

            <h2> Geography</h2>

            <p>The island of Hokkaido is located at the north end of Japan, near Russia, and has coastlines on the Sea
                of Japan, the Sea of Okhotsk, and the Pacific Ocean. The center of the island has a number of mountains
                and volcanic plateaux, and there are coastal plains in all directions. Major cities include Sapporo and
                Asahikawa in the central region and the port of Hakodate facing Honshu.</p>

            <p>The governmental jurisdiction of Hokkaido incorporates several smaller islands, including Rishiri,
                Okushiri Island, and Rebun. (By Japanese reckoning, Hokkaido also incorporates several of the Kuril
                Islands).
                Because the prefectural status of Hokkaido is denoted by the dō in its name, it is rarely referred to
                as
                "Hokkaido Prefecture", except when necessary to distinguish the governmental entity from the island.</p>

            <p>The island ranks 21st in the world by area. It is 3.6% smaller than the island of Ireland while
                Hispaniola is 6.1% smaller than Hokkaido. By population it ranks 20th, between Ireland and Sicily.
                Hokkaido's
                population is 4.7% less than that of the island of Ireland, and Sicily's is 12% lower than Hokkaido's.</p>

            <p>In the east, there are two areas (surrounding, for example, Shari and the Nakashibetsu Airport) where a
                grid with spacing of nearly 3 km is formed by narrow bands of forest.[citation needed] It was designed
                to
                buffer wind, especially during blizzards, to protect cattle. It also serves as habitat and
                transportation
                corridors for animals and hikers.</p>
