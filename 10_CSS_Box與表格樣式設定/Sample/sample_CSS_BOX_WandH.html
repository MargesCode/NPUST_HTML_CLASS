            <h2>Hokkaido </h2>
            <p>Hokkaido, formerly known as Ezo, Yezo, Yeso, or Yesso, is the second largest island of Japan,
                and the largest and northernmost prefecture. The Tsugaru Strait separates Hokkaido from Honshu.[1] The
                two islands are connected by the undersea railway Seikan Tunnel. The largest city on Hokkaido is its
                capital, Sapporo, which is also its only ordinance-designated city. About 43 km north of Hokkaido lies
                Sakhalin Island, Russia. To its east and north-east are the disputed Kuril Islands.</p>
